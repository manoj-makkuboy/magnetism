 * clients will not need to be authenticated with the server.
 * <p/>
 * The Java Keystore (JKS) takes a single password which must apply to both the
 * keystore and the key itself. Users may specify another keystore type and keystore
 * location. Alternatively, don't set a keystore type to use the JVM defaults and
 * configure your JVMs security files (see your JVM documentation) to plug in
 * any TrustManagerFactory provider.
