		<section name="Configuring Java AIM Bot">
			<p>After downloading Java AIM Bot you must configure it using the
				provided properties file. The bot.properties file can be found
				in the conf directory.</p>
			<subsection name="Specifying a username and password (REQUIRED)">
				<p>You must specify a valid AIM username and password. You can
					obtain an AIM username by visiting <a
					href="http://my.screenname.aol.com/">AOL's screename service</a>
					.</p>
				<p>Once you have a screename and password you should specify
					them in the bot.properties file by editing the following
					lines:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
aim.username=
aim.password=

]]></source>
				<p>For example, if your username is <b>myUserName</b> and your
					password is <b>myPassword</b> you should edit the file as
					follows:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
aim.username=myUserName
aim.password=myPassword

]]></source>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Specifying an bot Administrator (OPTIONAL)">
				<p>Once you have specified a username and password for your bot,
					you can actually run it, but you probably want to specify
					your own screename as an Administrator of the bot. This will
					allow you to access privileged commands, such as the
					ability to remove users and specify other administrators.</p>
				<p>This can be accomplished by setting the following line to
					your screename:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
bot.admin=
]]></source>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Making your bot public or private (OPTIONAL)">
				<p>By default your bot will only allow actual users of the bot
					to access its services. You can set the following property
					to <i>true</i> to have the bot automatically add all
					screenames that message it, to its users list. You should
					change the following line:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
#bot.autoadd=false
]]></source>
				<p>To this:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
bot.autoadd=true
]]></source>
			<p><b>NOTE:</b> It is recommended that if you run a private bot, you also configure it
				to ignore non-users (so they can't warn it).  See information on how to do this with
				the bot.nonuser.response property below.
			</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Enforcing only users can use the bot (OPTIONAL)">
				<p>By default your bot will only allow actual users of the bot
					to access its services (buddys are not users). You can set the following property
					to <i>false</i> to have the bot allow buddys as well as users to use it. You should
					change the following line:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
#bot.enforceUser=true
]]></source>
				<p>To this:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
bot.enforceUser=false
]]></source>
			<p><b>NOTE:</b> It is recommended that you leave this true, which allows you to have buddies in your buddy
			list that can't use the bot's services.
			</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Specifying your bot's profile (OPTIONAL)">
				<p>By default your bot's profile will point people to this project. You
					can change this to something more personal by editing the following
					property:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
#bot.profile=I'm running code from:\n http://jaimbot.sourceforge.net/
]]></source>
				<p>You can change this message, by uncommenting that property and setting it
					to anything else.  <b>IMPORTANT:</b> It must all be on one line; if you
					want mutlipe line, you can use \n instead of returns.</p>
				<p>For example, if you want the bot to say "I'm not a bot." you should edit the file as
					follows:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
bot.profile=I'm not a bot.
]]></source>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Specifying what to say to non-users (OPTIONAL)">
				<p>Since, by default, your bot will only allow actual users of the bot
					to access its services you may want to personalize what your bot says
					to a person that messages it, that isn't yet a user.  The following line
					allows you to configure this:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
#bot.nonuser.response=Sorry, you must be a user of this system to send requests.
]]></source>
				<p>You can change this message, by uncommenting that property and setting it
					to anything else.  <b>IMPORTANT:</b> It must all be on one line; if you
					want mutlipe line, you can use \n instead of returns.</p>
				<p>For example, if you want the bot to say "You need to be registered to use this
					bot, please visit my website to register:<br/>http://your.web.site.com/." you should edit the file as
					follows:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
bot.nonuser.response=You need to be registered to use this bot, please visit my website to register:\nhttp://your.web.site.com/.
]]></source>
				<p>
					If you want your bot to ignore non-users (which is recommended if you are running a 
					private bot).  You can uncomment this property and set it to nothing.  This way
					non-users will not be able to warn your bot.  You can achieve this by setting the property
					as follows:
				</p>
					<source><![CDATA[
bot.nonuser.response=]]></source>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Saving your settings (OPTIONAL)">
				<p>By default your bot will save its settings and state to a file when it 
					is shutdown (even by killing the JVM), which it will read the next time it
					is started to reapply the settings and state. You can set the following property
					to <i>false</i> to disable this behavior. You should
					change the following line:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
#bot.autopersist=true
]]></source>
				<p>To this:</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
bot.autopersist=false
]]></source>
			<p><b>NOTE:</b> If you disable this you will need to send the message "persist" to the bot
			as an admin in order to save its settings and state before you shut it down.
			</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Specifying logging options (OPTIONAL)">
				<p>The following options let you specify the level of output
					that should show up in the log file, and specify the name of
					the file. To set them you should first remove the "#"
					symbol, then set them to an appropriate value.</p>
				<source><![CDATA[
# SEVERE (big problems)> WARNING (problems) > INFO (system status) > FINE (all aim messages)> FINEST (gory details)
#logger.level=INFO

#Defaults <aim.username>_aimbot.log.xml
#logger.file=
]]></source>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Specifying the modules to load (OPTIONAL)">
				<p>You can also specify which modules you want loaded into the
					bot and which order they should be loaded. To load a module
					into the bot you should have an entry in the file like
					"mod.X=MODNAME" where X is the number which specifies the
					order in which the module should be loaded, and MODNAME is
					the fully specified class name of the module.</p>
				<p>Module 0 is a special module which will get all requests that
					aren't serviced by other modules. By default this is set to
					the MegaHal AI chatter bot module.</p>
				<p>The following are the default settings and will probably work fine for 
					your bot unless you want to enable/disable a specific module, or
					if you want to load your own custom modules.</p>
