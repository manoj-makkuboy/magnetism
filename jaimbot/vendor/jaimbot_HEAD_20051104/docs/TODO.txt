Add a module to completely manage roles:
	-add role to buddy
	-remove role from buddy
	
	
Is there an alternative in the Protocol for the watchdog thread to use beside AIMing itself?
	-some sort of echo response?	(KEEP_ALIVE maybe?)

*DONE* Add toc_get_status <screenname> call when we recieve an AIM from an offline buddy (may help when we have more than MAX buddies)

*DONE*
	autoaddbuddy in aimclient will only add a buddy (not add User role).
	AIMCLient should never use Roles!
	
	add a property enforceUser to bot that when true, will cause bot to check for user role before passing on to modules
		-so, when enforced, the modules will never see requests from non-users
		-when not enforced, any "buddy" can use the services
	
	this allows server-side "buddies" to be stored, but aimbot still managages meta-information and controls access.
	Thus a jaimbot-user could use their own username, load in all their buddies from the server to the bot, but 
	still manage the ACL themselves.  The new module (described below) will allow them to easily convert all their buddies to users.

*DONE* Add a module to:
	- convert all buddies to users
	- (change adduser to check for buddy existing, but not having User role, and add it)
	- purge all non-users from buddy list
	- purge "in-active" buddies
		-no-messages, no-preferences, no-roles (besides User), (make sure not to remove the bot itself ;) )
