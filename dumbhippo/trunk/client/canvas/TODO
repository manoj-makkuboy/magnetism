List of possible future enhancements / likely directions, we are doing these "as needed"

- HippoCanvasContainer
 
  add HippoCanvasContainer interface, add set_parent/get_parent on canvas item that 
  gets/sets a container, move get_position and set_child_visible from box to container

- Set font and text fg color on entire boxes w/ children

  add some way to "cascade" properties; most simply, just having each parent create layouts
  for its children that have the font of the parent would be very helpful and avoid
  a bunch of "font" properties we have right now; but cascading certain other props
  could also be right. Text foreground color for example. Maybe text properties
  and only text properties are the ones that make sense here. In that case 
  the whole feature can be done via the existing create_layout function.

- Set class-default font and colors

  if you allow setting a box to "gray 11px" for example, then the CanvasLink items in there 
  will override the gray with blue, since links default to blue. So each item should 
  first use its own props, then its container's props, then its class props, then its
  parent class props.

- Avoid having to always align images

  image item should maybe default to center alignment instead of fill like most items do

- Allow composite items to be activated/prelighted

  e.g. in one place in mugshot we have a CLOSE link and then an X icon next to it; should be able 
  to make the box containing those two a composite button, where the whole thing prelights 
  as a whole, and you can connect to "activated" on the whole thing.

- Naming of get_width_request / get_height_request

  With get_natural_width there, naming these get_min_width/get_min_height makes some 
  amount of sense. request is sort of gtk jargon.

  Or really, merging into something like:
    get_width_request(item, &minimum, &natural);
    get_height_request(item, for_width, &minimum, &natural);
  The merging makes it easier to implement in items, since the min/natural code is often
  related or the same. Note also the addition of natural height, something 
  we don't have right now.
