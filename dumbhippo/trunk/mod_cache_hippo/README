This is a slightly modified version of mod_cache that looks at whether
the web browser sent our authorization Cookie into account when deciding
whether to serve data from the cache.

The basic extension is that if the authorization cookie is found, 
caching will be skipped, since we need to serve the user-specific view
of the site to the user.

mod_cache is extended with two new configuration directives:

 CacheHippoServerName machine.example.com

   The server name encoded into the authorization cookie to look for.
   This is needed because web browsers will sometimes send multiple
   cookies, especially when we have servers at both 
   dumbhippo.com and dogfood.dumbhippo.com. (For example)

   If this is not set, all authorization cookies will be ignored.

 CacheHippoAlways /path

   Ignores the presence of authorization cookies for a particular
   URL path prefix. This is used for paths like /javascript
   /css where the content doesn't depend on the user. This 
   directive can be specified multiple times.

Both directives can be used at the global scope or for a particular
virtual server, though only the latter really makes sense.
