This document defines the steps required to create a release of Jaimbot.

--<==== Prepare the Release ==>--

1.	Check out fresh working copy of jaimbot module from CVS.
2.	Set the release version number in Maven project.xml and in Ant build.xml.
	For example, jaimbot-1.2.1 would become jaimbot-1.3 for an incremental release.
	-For Maven:
		-<currentVersion>1.3</currentVersion>
		-also add version to versions list:
			<version>
      			<id>1.3</id>
      			<name>1.3</name>
      			<tag>jaimbot-1_3</tag>
			</version>
	-For Ant:
		-<property name="version" value="1.3"/>
3.	Search and replace the version in any documentation in the xdocs directory.	
4.	Perform a successful build, and site generation (maven site).
5.	Check for any problems in the project reports (specifically: metrics, pmd, and make sure cvs reports worked).
6.	Verify the Configure and Run instructions are still accurate on the website.
7.	Run "ant changelog" and see whats new, save the changelog.html somewhere.
8.	Summarize the significant changes in a text file (for use later).
9.	Update the release date in the Ant build.xml (used to generate the changelog from above), to today's date.
	-e.g.   <property name="version.date" value="30 Apr 2003"/>
10.	Commit your changes to the version control repository. 
11.	Tag the release via cvs -q tag PROJECT_VERSION_MODIFIER. e.g.  jaimbot-1_2_1 or jaimbot-1_3
