		Right now the DumbHippo site is experimental and open only to a select few
		who are willing to help us improve. We're still fine-tuning the details of
		exactly how it works, and the site may malfunction from time to time. Please be
		patient, and avoid providing sensitive information that you would not post
		to a public forum. If you have any concerns please contact
		us at <a href="mailto:feedback@dumbhippo.com">feedback@dumbhippo.com</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Again, please treat the site as a public forum. Information you provide 
		may be disclosed to others, either as part of normal site features or
		inadvertently due to a bug in the software.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		We do not knowingly allow accounts for children under the age of 13.
		Please do not register for the site if you are under the age of 13.
		Parents, please do not register your child on the site if they are under 
		13.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		You can edit your information or disable an account by logging in 
		to your <a href="/account">account page</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Stern warnings aside, we'd like to give you a rough and informal idea of how the site
		is intended to work:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Most things on DumbHippo are visible to your friends only. For example, 
			your friends can see your other friends, the groups you're in, your email 
			and AIM addresses (if you provide them), and so forth.
			</li>
			<li>A stranger you haven't added as a friend can see some limited information, 
			such as your name and photo, and (if you have music sharing enabled) 
			the song you're listening to right now. They can also see any 
			public groups you're in, but not private groups.
			</li>
			<li>If you disable your account on the <a href="/account">account page</a>,
			your information will be pulled down and not visible to others.
			</li>
			<li>
			The DumbHippo software running on your computer looks at whether you're around 
			and when you look at shared stuff, in order to display that information to your 
			friends. If you enable music sharing, we track a history of what music
			you listen to so your friends can browse it.
			</li>
			<li>
			Our computers may look at what people are sharing and use that to 
			provide personalized recommendations and advertising.
			</li>
			<li>
			In the future we plan to add more features that involve sharing
			between friends, and fine-tune the way the site works including 
			in some cases who can see what information. We intend to keep 
			the spirit of the site similar to its current spirit but details
			may change.
			</li>
			<li>
			We do not spam. We send mail judiciously, and give you the 
			option to turn it off. We will not sell any of your addresses
			to others.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Please send any suggestions or concerns to us at 
		<a href="mailto:feedback@dumbhippo.com">feedback@dumbhippo.com</a>.
