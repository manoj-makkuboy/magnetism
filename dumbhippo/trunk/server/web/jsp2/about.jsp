	<p>Mugshot is an experiment in software design for people.</p>

	<p>Mugshot is guided by three principles:
	<ul>
		<li>Freedom - Choice among software and service providers</li>
		<li>Liveness - Active, dynamic connections between people</li>
		<li>Entertainment - Living and fun, not work and productivity</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>Mugshot is currently operating a limited user trial, with new
	accounts available on an invitation-only basis until we scale things
	up. If you'd like to participate in the trial or be notified when
	Mugshot is generally available, <a href="/">let us know</a>. 
	Until then, feel free to <a href="/">browse the site</a> to get a feel 
	for where we're headed.</p>

	<p>Mugshot is designed and developed in the context of an open source
	community project. For information on how you can contribute, visit
	<a href="/">our developer site</a> and <a href="/">our blog</a>.</p>

	<p>Mugshot makes use of public web services from a variety of
	commercial and non-commercial service providers. <a href="/">Learn more about
	Mugshot's use of web services</a>.</p>
