    <p>Martin: Well, you don't know my cat. It's very demanding.<br/>
    Debi: It? You don't know if it's a boy or a girl?<br/>
    Martin: I respect its privacy.<br>

	<p>FIXME: formal privacy policy from legal</p>
	
	<p>An informal summary of the way privacy on the site works:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Most things on the site are visible to your friends only. For example, 
			your friends can see your other friends, the groups you're in, your email 
			and AIM addresses (if you provide them), and so forth.
			</li>
			<li>A stranger you haven't added as a friend can see some limited information, 
			such as your name and photo, and (if you have music sharing enabled) 
			the song you're listening to right now. They can also see any 
			public groups you're in, but not private groups.
			</li>
			<li>If you disable your account on the <a href="/account">account page</a>,
			your information will be pulled down and not visible to others.
			</li>
			<li>
			If you install it, the client software running on your computer looks at whether 
			you're around  and when you look at shared stuff, in order to display that 
			information to your friends. If you enable music sharing, we track a history of 
			what music you listen to so your friends can browse it.
			</li>
			<li>
			Our computers may look at what people are sharing and use that to 
			provide personalized recommendations.
			</li>
			<li>
			In the future we plan to add more features that involve sharing
			between friends, and fine-tune the way the site works including 
			in some cases who can see what information. We intend to keep 
			the spirit of the site similar to its current spirit but details
			may change.
			</li>
			<li>
			We do not spam. We send mail judiciously, and give you the 
			option to turn it off. We will not sell any of your addresses
			to others.
			</li>
		</ul>
