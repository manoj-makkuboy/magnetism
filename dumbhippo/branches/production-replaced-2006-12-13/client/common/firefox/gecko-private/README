In order to create the Firefox component, we needed to use a small
number of private Firefox interfaces (basically, 
nsIScriptSecurityManager::CheckSameOrigin). 

To enable people to build the Firefox component with the packaged 
public SDK, instead of requiring them to build the Firefox sources
from scratch, we've included a small number of header files here. 

The headers here are extracted from a build of Firefox-1.5.0.4; the
source IDL files are included for completeness, but aren't used.
